# Script-example for 1d data generation

# ydata_all.txt has 4 rows, one for each output,
# and k columns; in this case, k=1, i.e. one measurement per condition
echo "10" > ydata_all.txt
echo "3" >> ydata_all.txt
echo "4" >> ydata_all.txt
echo "3" >> ydata_all.txt

# let's take surrogate errors as placeholder for data noise
cp surr_errors.dat dataerr_all.dat

# let's use data from all x-conditions for calibration
awk '{print 1}' xdata_all.txt > ind_calib.dat

# generate_quad -d1 -g NC -x full -p 111
# mv qdpts.dat xdata_all.txt
# awk '{print 3+$1-$1*$1}' xdata_all.txt > ydata_all.txt


# name the x-conditions for plotting convenience,
# this should have as many rows as the number of columns in xdata_all.txt
echo "QoI Id" > xcond_names.txt
